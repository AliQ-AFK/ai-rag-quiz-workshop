    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning models designed to understand and generate human language. They are trained on massive datasets of text to predict and generate language based on given prompts, learning patterns, structures, and relationships in text to produce human-like responses. They can be used to generate text, answer questions, and more.\n",

    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines language generation with real-time data retrieval, allowing models to access external sources or databases to provide more accurate, contextually relevant answers.\n",

    "- Retrieval: This component searches and retrieves relevant information from external databases or documents.\n",
    "- Generation: This component uses the retrieved information to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n",
