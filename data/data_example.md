Topics


What are LLMs?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets of text to predict and generate language based on given prompts, learning patterns, structures, and relationships in text to produce human-like responses.

How do they work?

What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines language generation with real-time data retrieval, allowing models to access external sources or databases to provide more accurate, contextually relevant answers.


What is a hallucination?
 A hallucination in AI refers to when a model generates information that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect or unsupported by the training data.


Closed source vs Open source LLMs

Closed-source LLMs are proprietary, with code and models kept private, while open-source LLMs allow public access to the model architecture and often the training data, enabling more transparency and community-driven improvements.


Prompt engineering
Prompt Tuning: Technique of adjusting the embeddings of prompts rather than the prompt text itself to improve model output. It is 

What is Fine-tunning?
TBD

 What are multimodal models? 
Multimodal models can process and integrate multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio, to create richer and more comprehensive outputs across different input types.

Evaluation
Evaluation in LLMs measures model performance using metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and coherence, assessing how well the model fulfills its intended purpose and meets user needs.
LLM-based applications require systematic testing and evaluation due to their complexity. (2)

Monitoring 

Monitoring involves tracking an LLMâ€™s performance in real-time use to ensure accuracy, reliability, and ethical standards are maintained, often incorporating feedback to improve model outputs over time.

Examples of applying Gen AI
Generative AI can be used for tasks like customer service automation, content creation, coding assistance, personalized marketing, and even medical data analysis, driving efficiency and innovation across industries.


Ethical considerations
Ethical issues in AI include data privacy, fairness, transparency, accountability, and the prevention of biases or harmful outputs, necessitating careful oversight and responsible model design.


Who are important role models in the field of AI & ML?

Chip Huyen: Writes  a cool blog  about ML and AI
Timnit Gebru: An AI scientist that have many influential papers on AI ethics
Andrej Karpathy: Research scientist on various influential roles in OpenAI, tesla, and more, keeps a very cool youtube channel explaining the fundamentals of large language models.
